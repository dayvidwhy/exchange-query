# I'm Feeling Stacky
An example of multiple API callbacks to search for more in depth data from an online API endpoint.

## Getting Started

### What is this
We make a series of calls to the [StackExchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/) to find the top answer to the most relevant question asked.

### Goals and Requirements
Stack Overflow presents a large amount of information when you search for something, and I think overt ime the API search functionality can be extended to consider multiple answers and give the most appropriate one for the search.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Vue

### To-Do
* Improve search results
* Learn more about stack-exchange api
* Add some nicer styles

## Contributing
Please create a github issue with your suggested change and submit a pull request for consideration.
