# feeling-stacky
I made this as an example of multiple API callbacks to search for more in depth data.
We make a series of calls to the stackexchange api to find the top answer to the most relevant question asked.

### Why?
I think that stackoverflow presents an overflow (he he) of information when you search for something, and I think overtime the API search functionality can be extended to consider multiple answers and give the most appropriate one for the search.

###To-Do
*Improve search results
*Learn more about stack-exchange api
*add some nicer styles
